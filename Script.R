# Section 03 The Series has TREND and SEASONALITY
# Let's try to forecast


# 01. Benchmark Methods - SEASONAL NAIVE METHOD: T_y = T_(y-s) + Random Error
# Remember to use the DIFFERENCE DATA and not the RAW DATA due to the TREND

fit <- snaive(DY)
print(summary(fit))   # Residual SD 28006.2207
checkresiduals(fit)
#-----------------

# 02. Exponential Smoothing Model 
# We can use REGULAR RAW DATA

fit_ets <- ets(Y)         #tries a number of exponential smoothing models and returns the best
print(summary(fit_ets))   # Residual SD 0.1312
checkresiduals(fit_ets)
#-----------------


# 03. ARIMA
# Data in ARIMA needs to be STATIONARY: use the Diff data and tell there ise

fit_arima <- auto.arima (Y,d=1, D=1, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE, trace = TRUE) #we can use the original Y data, using the d=1 parameter
print(summary(fit_arima))   # Residual SD 21293.75 #warning ARIMA returns VARIANCE ==> SD^2

# Section 04 LET's FORECAST
