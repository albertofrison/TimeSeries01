library (fpp2)    # forecasting package
library (tidyverse) #we will need to tidy the data - later - for plotting on ggplot the right way
library (tseries) #used for some tests


##### 
# Section 01 - Loading the Data

tail (data) # last 06 records

#####
# Section 02 - Cleaning the Data
# Substituting 2 outliers in data due to COVID with monthly averages
# Unfortunately March and April 2020 shows two outliers, I chose to deal with them by substituting to them the mean of these months of the previous years
# Note, I will also add May as by looking at RESIDUALS, while checking the forecast fit, it seems that even May 2020 is too extreme

# Let's create a new dimension to store the month name (01 for January) so we can calculate monthly averages
# I add here the Month_Name column to identify each month of the series
data <- data %>%
  mutate (Month_Name = format(as.Date(Month, tryFormats = "%d/%m/%Y"),"%m"),
          Year_Name = format(as.Date(Month, tryFormats = "%d/%m/%Y"),"%Y"))

# Let's graphically see these outliers
data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Month_Name, y= Registrations))

# DO NOT DELETE ME as working with dates is always a HELL
# in the as.Date function use TRYFORMATS to tell in which format the date is, then extract the YEAR (for instance) using the %Y in format()
# format(as.Date("01/04/2020",tryFormats = "%d/%m/%Y"),"%Y")

# Now we are there let's also have a look at the data by year
# Note: the reason that 2022 registrations are difficult to forecast as the market is performing very badly in respect to the past years
data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Year_Name, y= Registrations))

# Now I filter out the two "wrong" months and I calculate, visually, the averages to be used to "correct" the outliers
data %>%
  filter (Month != c("01/03/2020", "01/04/2020", "01/05/2020")) %>%
  group_by (Month_Name) %>%
  summarize (Mean = mean(Registrations))

# Finally I substitute the averages into the "actual" data
data[which(data[,1]=="01/03/2020"),2] <- 201242
data[which(data[,1]=="01/04/2020"),2] <- 171174

# ... now if you run the boxplot chart here above the outliers have disappeared...

# Section 03 - Let's start to work with time series
# DECLARING THE TIMESERIES
# declare a new variable Y as Time Series (just the second column) - Y_entire gets the WHOLE 
Y_entire <- ts(data[,2], start = c(1990,1), end = c(2023,12), frequency = 12) # remember to check the ending month at each update
class (Y_entire) # time series
head (Y_entire) # this is consistent with the head() of the data.frame only that now is a ts() format
tail (Y_entire) # it ends where it should - jan to june 2022 - therefore I expect no errors in the ts() definition


# SELECTING THE TRAINING SET
# in order to effectively understand the validy of our forecast modesl, we can split the data in two: the TRAINING set and the TEST set
# this is the TRAINING SET --- you can play with the start // end of the training set to see what works better to forecast
# for the sake of the exercise we can use the last year (2023) as test data and play with the rest of the data for the training set
Y <- window (Y_entire, start = c(1990,1), end = c(2022,12))
head (Y) # deciding to start in xxxx is completely subjective
tail (Y) # yes, we leave the remaining 2022 months outside the TRAINING SET to be used to evaluate the correctness of our foreasts

  ggtitle ("New Passengers Cars Registrations [Italy]") + 
  ylab ("Registration - Month over Month Seasonality")

# CONCLUSION: THE SERIES HAS TREND AND SEASONALITY, WE CAN NOW EXPLORE DIFFERENT WAYS TO FORECAST FOR THE FUTURE


# HOW TO GET RID OF SEASONALITY ? 
# 1. SEASONAL DIFFERENCING 
# Seasonal differentiating aims to subtract each data point by a previous data point of a fixed lag i.e. 12
seasonal_diff_Y <- diff (Y, lag = 12, differences = 1) # calculates the difference ts with a 12 month lag

# check the results
par (mfrow = c(2,2)) # two rows by two columns
plot (Y, main = "New Car Registrations", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (Y, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF")
plot (seasonal_diff_Y, main = "Differenciated Data - Lag 12", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (seasonal_diff_Y, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF")
par (mfrow = c(1,1)) # graphical parameters reset

Diff_methods[2,1] <- "SEASONAL DIFFERENCING"
Diff_methods[2,2] <- var (seasonal_diff_Y)

# 2. SEASONAL MEANS
# Seasonal means aims to subtract each data point by its respective group average, the monthly average
# Y goes from 2005 to 2021 included
seasonal_mean_Y <- data.frame (
  year = rep (1990:2022, each = 12),
  month = rep (1:12),
  value = Y) # prepare a dataframe to be used to calculate the MONTHLY AVERAGE in the next line of code

seasonal_mean_Y_xbars <- aggregate (value ~ month, data = seasonal_mean_Y, mean) # aggregate values by month, of the dataframe hence created using the mean as formula
seasonal_mean_Ydiff <- Y - seasonal_mean_Y_xbars$value # store into a variable the difference of each data point versus the monthly average

# check the results
par (mfrow = c(2,2)) # two rows by two columns
plot (Y, main = "New Car Registrations", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (Y, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF")
plot (seasonal_mean_Ydiff, main = "Differenciated Data - Monthly Average", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (seasonal_mean_Ydiff, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF") # doesn't look good
par (mfrow = c(1,1)) # graphical parameters reset

Diff_methods[3,1] <- "SEASONAL MEANS"
Diff_methods[3,2] <- var (seasonal_mean_Ydiff)

# 3. METHOD OF THE MOVING AVERAGES - DECOMPOSING A TIME SERIES 
decomposed_Y <- decompose (Y) # decomposes the ts into DATA (observed), the Trend, the Seasonal effect an the Random (noise) effects
plot(decomposed_Y) 

trend_Y <- decomposed_Y$trend
seasonal_Y <- decomposed_Y$seasonal
random_Y <- decomposed_Y$random

# check the results

# Section 08 - FORECASTING
# Let's try to forecast by fitting and ARIMA model and using manual parameters through ACF and PACF interpretation
# Arima (p,d,q) is composed of 3 hyperparameters:
# p = Autoregression (AR)
# d = Differencing (I)
# q = Moving Average (MA)
m <- matrix(c(1,1,2,3),2,2,byrow = TRUE)
layout(m)
plot (Y, main= "", ylab ="")
abline(a = mean(Y), b =0, lty = 3, col = "blue") #mean
abline(a = mean(Y) + sd(Y), b =0, lty = 4, col = "red") #mean +sd
abline(a = mean(Y) - sd(Y), b =0, lty = 4, col = "red") #mean +sd
Acf(Y,main="")
Pacf(Y,main="")

# let's fit a potential arima model and see how it performs -
# TODO: Review more on how to interpret ACF and PACF to instruct a model

fit_arima <- auto.arima(Y, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE, parallel = TRUE, allowdrift = TRUE)

# Techniques to check the FIT of a Model
# a.look at the ERRORS TABLE (ME,MAE, RMSE, ....) and the VARIANCE 
print(summary(fit_arima)) # here you check errors Mean Error, RMSE, Mean Percentage Error, and so on

# b. Graph of Residuals - checking their MEAN (that should be ZERO) and how VARIANCE changes over time STABLE VARIANCE
# here you check residuals chart, acf and distribution - ACF on the residuals should be SMALL and demonstrate NO significant patterns and 
# in order to conclude that the RESISUALS are independent
checkresiduals(fit_arima)  # 
mean(fit_arima$residuals) # this is he MEAN ERROR, the first error type (ME) returned by summary(fit_arima)

# c. let's see Lijung-Box Test
# this test is a statistical test that measure whether or not a group of auto-correlations in a time series are different from ZERO
# if the p-value of the test is GREATER than 0.05 (5%) then we do NOT reject the null hypotheses and conclude that the model is a good fit
# each model can always be compared one another by looking at the smalles Standard Deviation of the Residuals
Box.test (fit_arima$residuals, type = "Ljung-Box", lag = 24) #p-value = IF xxxx > 5% the model is a good fit for the data


# d. AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) or, a measure of the trade-between the goodness of the fit of the model and the number of parameters in the model
# it is a way to try to avoid OVERFITTING: many parameters might provide a good fit for the data, but not generate a good PREDICTOR of the future - in the
# other hand a model with few parameters might not be sufficient to capture the patterns in the data.
# Steps: 
#   1. we establish an ARIMA (p,d,q) model and cycle over for loops to identity which p,q combination yields the lower AIC (or BIC??? see below)
#   2. we loop over p,d,q parameters to look for the best (lowest) AIC

aic_result <- numeric (4) # 

for (p in 0:2) {
  for (d in 0:2) {
    for (q in 0:2) {
      aic <- arima (Y, order = c(p,d,q), seasonal = c(2,1,1))$aic  
      aic_result <- rbind(aic_result, c(p,d,q,aic))
    }
  }
}

aic_result <- aic_result [-1,]
colnames (aic_result) <- c("p","d","q", "AIC")
aic_result
min(aic_result[,4]) #8597.504 c(2,2,1)

# TO DO look at the best model fit ARIMA and compare the AICs, the best ARIMA model (auto.arima) should have the lowest AIC (or BIC??? see below)


#####
# Section 09  Let's try to forecast
# Foreword: one can start with a very simple model (i.e. the NAIVE) just to have a benchmart for the most advanced models

# 01. Benchmark Methods - SEASONAL NAIVE METHOD: T_y = T_(y-s) + Random Error

# We can use REGULAR RAW DATA
# tries a number of exponential smoothing models and returns the best
fit_ets <- ets(Y)         
print(summary(fit_ets))   
checkresiduals(fit_ets)


# 03. ARIMA
# Auto.arima automatically fits the best model with differing (p,d,q) coordinates - then the BEST model is the one with the LOWEST BIC (Bayesian Info Criterion)
# TO DO: learn better if the parameer that auto.arima looks for is BIC or AIC
fit_arima <- auto.arima (Y, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE, trace = TRUE)

# 2. add x labels into the data frame to tame the x axis
# 3. use group = 1 to allow for geom_line to work - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27082601/ggplot2-line-chart-gives-geom-path-each-group-consist-of-only-one-observation

# 4.a COLORS needs to stay inside the aes() otherwise the legend will NOY show up!
# 4.b the sames goes with the linetype which you can "name" but not select and have to play around
