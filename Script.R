# Section 01 Load the Data
data <- read.delim ("data/Passengers_Cars_Registrations_Italy.csv", sep = ";") # Passenger Cars Registrations in Italy from 1990 - Today (updated June 2022)

Y_entire <- ts(data[,2], start = c(1990,1), end = c(2022,6), frequency = 12) # declare a new variable Y as Time Series (just the second column)

# Section 02 Preliminary Analysis
# Time Plot
autoplot (Y) + 
  ggtitle ("New Passengers Cars Registrations [Italy]") + 
  ylab ("Registrations") +
  xlab ("Year")
# data looks SEASONAL (to be confirmed) and with a downward TREND


# DIFFERENCE FUNCTION DATA TO GET RID OF THE TREND
DY <- diff(Y) # change of registrations from month to month (feb 1990 - jan 1990)
autoplot (DY) + 
  ggtitle ("New Passengers Cars Registrations [Italy]") + 
  ylab ("Registration - Month over Month Difference") +
  xlab ("Year")
# DY now contains the month over month changes in the time series

# INVESTIGATING SEASONALITY
# we got rid of the Trend, let's see if there is a monthly seasonality 

# ONE WAY TO LOOK AT SEASONALITY
ggseasonplot (DY) +
  ggtitle ("New Passengers Cars Registrations [Italy]") + 
  ylab ("Registration - Month over Month Difference")
# there is a clear seasonality in the data with increase of sales in January, as well as March, June and September and a decrease in August

# SECOND WAY TO EXPLORE SEASONALITY
ggsubseriesplot(DY) +
  ggtitle ("New Passengers Cars Registrations [Italy]") + 
  ylab ("Registration - Month over Month Seasonality")

# CONCLUSION: THE SERIES HAS TREND AND SEASONALITY, WE CAN NOW EXPLORE DIFFERENT WAYS TO FORECAST FOR THE FUTURE


#####
# Section 03  Let's try to forecast
# 01. Benchmark Methods - SEASONAL NAIVE METHOD: T_y = T_(y-s) + Random Error
# Remember to use the DIFFERENCE DATA and not the RAW DATA due to the TREND

fit <- snaive(DY) 
print(summary(fit))   
checkresiduals(fit)
class(fit)
# snaive doesn't look that performs very well, SD is 28k cars and ACF chart suggest lots of autocorrelation

# as alternative to checkresiduals function
res <- residuals (fit)
Acf(res, main ="ACF of Residuals - Naive Method")
hist(res, nclass= "FD", main ="Histogram of Residuals - Naive Method")



#-----------------
# 02. Exponential Smoothing Model 
# We can use REGULAR RAW DATA
fit_ets <- ets(Y)         #tries a number of exponential smoothing models and returns the best
print(summary(fit_ets))   
checkresiduals(fit_ets)


#-----------------
# 03. ARIMA
# Data in ARIMA needs to be STATIONARY: use the Diff data and tell there ise
fit_arima <- auto.arima (Y,d=1, D=1, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE, trace = TRUE) #we can use the original Y data, using the d=1 parameter
print(summary(fit_arima))   # Residual SD 21293.75 #warning ARIMA returns VARIANCE ==> SD^2  // 21161.46 (1990 - 2020)
