# Section 01a - Subdstituting 2 outliers in data due to COVID with monthly averages
# Unfortunately March and April 2020 shows two outliers, I chose to deal with them by substituting to them the mean of these months of the previous years
# Note, I will also add May as by looking at RESIDUALS, while checking the forecast fit, it seems that even May 2020 is too extreme

# Let's create a new dimension to store the month name (01 for January) so we can calculate monthly averages

# I add here the Month_Name column to identify each month of the series
data <- data %>%
  mutate (Month_Name = format(as.Date(Month, tryFormats = "%d/%m/%Y"),"%m"),
          Year_Name = format(as.Date(Month, tryFormats = "%d/%m/%Y"),"%Y"))

# DO NOT DELETE ME - working with dates is always a HELL
# in the as.Date function use TRYFORMATS to tell in which format the date is, then extract the YEAR (for instance) using the %Y in format()
# format(as.Date("01/04/2020",tryFormats = "%d/%m/%Y"),"%Y")

# Let's graphically see these outliers
data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Month_Name, y= Registrations))

# Reason that 2022 registrations are difficult to forecast as the market is performing very badly in respect to the past years
data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Year_Name, y= Registrations))

# Now I filter out the two "wrong" months and I calculate, visually, the averages
data %>%
  filter (Month != c("01/03/2020", "01/04/2020", "01/05/2020")) %>%
  group_by (Month_Name) %>%
  summarize (Mean = mean(Registrations))

# Finally I substitute the averages into the "actual" data

# ... now if you run the boxplot chart here above the outliers have disappeared...


# DECLARING THE TIMESERIES
# declare a new variable Y as Time Series (just the second column) - Y_entire gets the WHOLE 
Y_entire <- ts(data[,2], start = c(1990,1), end = c(2022,8), frequency = 12) # remember to check the ending month at each update
class (Y_entire) # time series
head (Y_entire) # this is consistent with the head() of the data.frame only that now is a ts() format
tail (Y_entire) # it ends where it should - jan to june 2022 - therefore I expect no errors in the ts() definition


# SELECTING THE TRAINING SET
# this is the TRAINING SET --- you can play with the start // end of the training set to see what works better to forecast
Y <- window (Y_entire, start = c(2011,1), end = c(2020,12))
head (Y) # deciding to start in 2005 is completely subjective
tail (Y) # yes, we leave the remaining 2022 months outside the TRAINING SET to be used to evaluate the correctness of our foreasts

  ggtitle ("New Passengers Cars Registrations [Italy]") + 
  ylab ("Registration - Month over Month Seasonality")
# CONCLUSION: THE SERIES HAS TREND AND SEASONALITY, WE CAN NOW EXPLORE DIFFERENT WAYS TO FORECAST FOR THE FUTURE

# HOW TO GET RID OF SEASONALITY ? 
# 1. SEASONAL DIFFERENCING 
# Seasonal differencing aims to subtract each data point by a previous data point of a fixed lag i.e. 12
seasonal_diff_Y <- diff (Y, lag = 12, differences = 1) # calculates the differenced ts with a 12 month lag

# check the results
par (mfrow = c(2,2)) # two rows by two columns
plot (Y, main = "New Car Registrations", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (Y, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF")
plot (seasonal_diff_Y, main = "Differenciated Data - Lag 12", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (seasonal_diff_Y, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF")
par (mfrow = c(1,1)) # graphical parameters reset

Diff_methods[2,1] <- "SEASONAL DIFFERENCING"
Diff_methods[2,2] <- var (seasonal_diff_Y)

# 2. SEASONAL MEANS
# Seasonal means aims to subtract each data point by its respective group average, the monthly average
# Y goes from 2005 to 2021 included
seasonal_mean_Y <- data.frame (
  year = rep (2005:2021, each = 12),
  month = rep (1:12),
  value = Y) # prepare a dataframe to be used to calculate the MONTHLY AVERAGE in the next line of code

seasonal_mean_Y_xbars <- aggregate (value ~ month, data = seasonal_mean_Y, mean) # aggregate values by month, of the dataframe hence created using the mean as formula
seasonal_mean_Ydiff <- Y - seasonal_mean_Y_xbars$value # store into a variable the difference of each data point versus the monthly average

# check the results
par (mfrow = c(2,2)) # two rows by two columns
plot (Y, main = "New Car Registrations", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (Y, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF")
plot (seasonal_mean_Ydiff, main = "Differenciated Data - Monthly Average", ylab = "Registrations")
Acf (seasonal_mean_Ydiff, main = "ACF", ylab = "ACF") # doesn't look good
par (mfrow = c(1,1)) # graphical parameters reset

Diff_methods[3,1] <- "SEASONAL MEANS"
Diff_methods[3,2] <- var (seasonal_mean_Ydiff)

# 3. METHOD OF THE MOVING AVERAGES - DECOMPOSING A TIME SERIES 
decomposed_Y <- decompose (Y) # decomposes the ts into DATA (observed), the Trend, the Seasonal effect an the Random (noise) effects
plot(decomposed_Y) 

trend_Y <- decomposed_Y$trend
seasonal_Y <- decomposed_Y$seasonal
random_Y <- decomposed_Y$random

# check the results

# Section 03A - Let's try to forecast by fitting and ARIMA model and using manual parameters through ACF and PACF interpretation
# Arima (p,d,q) is composed of 3 hyperparameters:
# p = Autoregression (AR)
# d = Differencing (I)
# q = Moving Average (MA)
m <- matrix(c(1,1,2,3),2,2,byrow = TRUE)
layout(m)
plot (Y, main= "", ylab ="")
abline(a = mean(Y), b =0, lty = 3, col = "blue") #mean
abline(a = mean(Y) + sd(Y), b =0, lty = 4, col = "red") #mean +sd
abline(a = mean(Y) - sd(Y), b =0, lty = 4, col = "red") #mean +sd
Acf(Y,main="")
Pacf(Y,main="")

# let's fit a potential arima model and see how it performs - since so far I undestood ZERO on how to interpret ACF and PACF to instruct a model
# let's just take the hyperparamenters calculated automatically by the auto.arima function below
fit_arima <- arima(Y, order = c(1,0,0), seasonal = c(2,1,1), include.mean = TRUE) # ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,1,1)[2] with drift

# Techniques to check the FIT of a Model
# a.look at the ERRORS TABLE (ME,MAE, RMSE, ....) and the VARIANCE # 443.412.708
print(summary(fit_arima)) # here you check errors Mean Error, RMSE, Mean Percentage Error, and so on

# b. Graph of Residuals - checking their MEAN (that should be ZERO) and how VARIANCE changes over time STABLE VARIANCE
# here you check residuals chart, acf and distribution - ACF on the residuals should be SMALL and demonstrate NO significant patterns and 
# in order to conclude that the RESISUALS are independent
checkresiduals(fit_arima)  # yes, except LAG-13 where there is a significant plot
mean(fit_arima$residuals) # this is he MEAN ERROR, the first error type (ME) returned by summary(fit_arima)

# c. let's see Lijung-Box Test
# this test is a statistical test that measure whether or not a group of auto-correlations in a time series are different from ZERO
# if the p-value of the test is GREATED than 0.05 (5%) then we do NOT reject the null hypotheses and conclude that the model is a good fit
Box.test (fit_arima$residuals, type = "Ljung-Box", lag = 24) #p-value = 0.9686 > 5% so the model is a good fit for the data


# d. AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) or, a measure of the trade-between the goodness of the fit of the model and the number of parameters in the model
# it is a way to try to avoid OVERFITTING: many parameters might provide a good fit for the data, but not generate a good PREDICTOR of the future - in the
# other hand a model with few parameters might not be sufficient to capture the patterns in the data.
# Steps: 
#   1. we establish an ARIMA (p,d,q) model and cycle over for loops to identity which p,q combination yields the lower AIC
#   2. we loop over p,d,q parameters to look for the best (lowest) AIC

aic_result <- numeric (4) # 

for (p in 0:2) {
  for (d in 0:2) {
    for (q in 0:2) {
      aic <- arima (Y, order = c(p,d,q), seasonal = c(2,1,1), include.drift = TRUE)$aic  
      aic_result <- rbind(aic_result, c(p,d,q,aic))
    }
  }

aic_result <- aic_result [-1,]
colnames (aic_result) <- c("p","d","q", "AIC")
aic_result
min(aic_result[,4]) #4095.542 order = c(1,2,2)

# looking at the model fit here below the best ARIMA model is Best model: # ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,1,1)[2] with drift
# fit_arima <- auto.arima (Y, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE, trace = TRUE)
# I am not sure why my AIC reports a different result := here the LOWEST AIC is at 4.371.436 order = c(1,2,2)

# Trying to get better looking charts... no luck so far...
# 23/07 SOLVED IT!!
# 1. convert all ts and forecast data into a data frame - use as.numeric to coherce the bastard
# 2. add x labels into the data frame to tame the x axis
# 3. use group = 1 to allow for geom_line to work - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27082601/ggplot2-line-chart-gives-geom-path-each-group-consist-of-only-one-observation
# 4. Still cannot control how legends works, found a turnaround, but cannot express my own colors and line shapes
# 4.a COLORS needs to stay inside the aes() otherwise the legend will NOY show up!
# 4.b the sames goes with the linetype which you can "name" but not select and have to play around

# now that I think about it , maybe the dataframe was not necessary and I could have plotted ts() and forecast data alltogether if only I used the bloody group = 1 inside the aes () from the beninning!!!!!
